ALM (Application Lifecycle Management)

    ...

    - continuous integration CI - version control

    - release management - CD
        - continuous delivery - teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually
        - continuous deployment - software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments


In the past

    - deploying software was a tedious and difficult process that required a lot of hands-on
    - in time it got automated and moved to the cloud 


CD pipelines 

    - automated chain of processing elements (output of one element is the input of the next)
    - test, build and deploy code
